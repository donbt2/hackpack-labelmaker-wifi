# 003 - Label Maker

The Label Maker requires two libraries to be installed in the Arduino IDE before it can be used:

## LiquidCrystal I2C

To install the LiquidCrystal I2C library, follow these steps:

1. Open the Arduino IDE
2. Click on the `Sketch` menu
3. Click on the `Include Library` menu
4. Click on the `Manage Libraries...` menu
5. In the `Library Manager` window, type `LiquidCrystal I2C` in the search box
6. Click on the `LiquidCrystal I2C by Frank de Brabander` entry in the list
7. Click on the `Install` button

Additional information about the LiquidCrystal I2C library can be found on the
[LiquidCrystal I2C GitHub repository](https://github.com/fdebrabander/Arduino-LiquidCrystal-I2C-library)

## ezButton

To install the ezButton library, follow these steps:

1. Open the Arduino IDE
2. Click on the `Sketch` menu
3. Click on the `Include Library` menu
4. Click on the `Manage Libraries...` menu
5. In the `Library Manager` window, type `ezButton` in the search box
6. Click on the `ezButton` entry in the list 
    - **NOTE:** There is also a library called `EZButton`. This is _not_ the correct library. Pick the one with a lower case `ez`.
7. Click on the `Install` button

Additional information about the ezButton library can be found on the
